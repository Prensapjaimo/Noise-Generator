# Noise Generator

Simple web app made with Vanilla Javascript that generates random noise.

This was made with the sole intention of practicing, it is not meant to be a commercial product. It is a very simple web app built just to practice Git/Github.

### If you want to DOWNLOAD the generated noise as a png image double click or right click the canvas and enter the name of the file.
